# Project : Covid Antibody Response and Infection Neutralization (CARIN)
- design: discuss how you plan to implement the project
    - architecture
        - identify important classes, packages, or components that make up your design
        - show how classes are composed and interact to accomplish design goals (a module dependency diagram is suggested)
        - present key interfaces provided by classes, and discuss any design patterns that you plan to use and why you choose them
        - discuss any important rep invariants maintained by classes
    - code design
        - describe data structures that will be used
        - discuss any tradeoffs you made between different design goals, such as between simplicity of code and efficiency of execution
      - tools
        - discuss any tools you have used or plan to use for the design and implementation of the project
    - a screenshot of the git repository for your team
    - your job is to convince the course staff that you thought carefully about the construction for the project
- testing: describe your testing plan
    - will your test cases have enough coverage of the input space?
    - will your test cases have enough coverage of your code?
- work plan
    - explain how you are dividing up the work, and in what order you plan to develop the various project components
    - identify any key dependencies between different implementation steps, where one team member cannot start an implementation task until another team member has completed
